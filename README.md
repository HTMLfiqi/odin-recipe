# hello

I'm in the process of creating my first basic recipe website, and it's been about three days since I started learning to code. It's challenging, but I'm enjoying the journey and the small victories along the way!


Creating my first recipe website is teaching me HTML and CSS basics for structuring and styling web pages across different devices. I'll update this README to track my progress and lessons learned as I manage challenges and refine my project skills.

Creating my first recipe website has been a rewarding journey into web development. I've learned HTML to structure my pages and begin creating a functional site. Overcoming challenges like debugging and refining layouts has been both challenging and motivating. Managing the project from start to finish has taught me valuable organizational skills, and seeking guidance from friends has been instrumental in my learning process. This experience has ignited my passion for coding and inspired me to continue exploring and improving my skills.
