I'm in the process of creating my first basic recipe website, and it's been about three days since I started learning to code. It's challenging, but I'm enjoying the journey and the small victories along the way!



Creating my first recipe website is teaching me HTML and CSS basics for structuring and styling web pages across different devices. I'll update this README to track my progress and lessons learned as I manage challenges and refine my project skills.
