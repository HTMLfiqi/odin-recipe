    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <b>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go (typically around 475-500Â°F)</li>
            <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet that's lightly coated with olive oil or
                cornmeal to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese generously over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add any additional toppings you like, such as basil, oregano, or pepperoni.</li>
            <li>Drizzle a little olive oil over the top and season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden
                brown
                and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes to set, then slice and enjoy your homemade
                cheese pizza!</li>
