    <p>Making a cheese pizza at home is easy and convenient because you can customize it with your favorite toppings,

        and delicious meal without the hassle of dining out or waiting for delivery.</p>

        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet that's lightly coated with olive oil or
            cornmeal to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese generously over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add any additional toppings you like, such as basil, oregano, or pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little olive oil over the top and season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
        <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown
            and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes to set, then slice and enjoy your homemade
            cheese pizza!</li>
    </ol>
